# HTI Counter Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Objectives

 - [x] React tutorial - https://react.dev/learn
 - [x] Redux quickstart guide - https://redux.js.org/tutorials/quick-start 
 - [x] Complete the Counter App example in the Redux quickstart guide, either in his preferred IDE or in https://codesandbox.io/ (The free tier has 3 free sandboxes)
 - [x] Make the App available to us by sending the CodeSandbox link so that we can view code and run it. If the applicant did it in his own IDE he can upload it to CodeSandbox.
 - [x] Bonus points if the applicant adds more functions to the Counter App like multiply and divide!
